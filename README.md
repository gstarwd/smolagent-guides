# Smolagents - Where Code Meets AI Agents 🤖

> Build smarter, faster AI agents without the bloat

## What is this magic? ✨

Imagine building an AI agent in less time than it takes to brew your morning coffee. That's [Smolagents](https://smolagents.org/) - Hugging Face's sleek new framework that turns complex AI agent development into a breeze. It's like having a Swiss Army knife for AI development, but without all the unnecessary tools you never use.

## Why should you care? 🎯

- **Tiny but mighty**: The entire core is just ~1000 lines of code. Yes, you read that right!
- **Code > JSON**: Write Python, not endless JSON configs
- **Speed demon**: 30% fewer steps and LLM calls than traditional approaches
- **Play nice with others**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, or any Hugging Face model
- **Safety first**: Built-in sandbox mode to keep things secure
- **Share & shine**: Push your tools to Hugging Face Hub with one line of code

## Who's it for? 👥

- The developer who values elegant solutions over complex architectures
- Startups that need to move fast without breaking things
- AI enthusiasts who want to focus on building, not configuring

```python
from smolagents import CodeAgent
agent = CodeAgent(tools=[your_tool])
# That's it. You're ready to rock!
```
